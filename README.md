(HA) Hypothesis: The adoption of Anti-E-cigarette legislation by states has a direct impact to reducing the percentage of adult E-cigarette users.

(Ho:) Null: The adoption of Anti-E-cigarette legislation by states does not have a direct impact on reducing the percentage of adult E-cigarette users.

Planned Analysis : We are going to compare the adult usage rate of the population data to sample data of states with high levels of Anti-E-cigarette legislation to determine statistical significance

Secondary Analysis : If correlation is determined between high legislation states, then we will determine which forms of legislation are more effective.
